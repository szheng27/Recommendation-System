A recommendation system suggests products to users based on their preferences. Using data from the Steam gaming platform, this analysis compares two methods: cosine similarity and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Cosine similarity measures similarity between users or items based on interaction vectors, while SVD reduces data dimensionality to uncover hidden patterns. This comparison evaluates the effectiveness of each method in predicting user preferences and improving recommendations.
